# Multi Dict

Use multiple languages when spell checking inside Firefox.

Supported languages are based on the dictionaries used for spell checking  Chrome, Firefox,
LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and many more apps that rely on the Hunspell spell checker.

## Usage

To enable spell checking for multiple languages:

1. open up Firefox and type `about:preferences` into the URL bar
2. scroll down the page and click the `Choose` button next to
   "Choose your preferred language for displaying pages"
3. add your desired languages by choosing the "Select a language to add" checkbox

You can trust the add-on to do all the spell checking for you, so feel free to disable the built-in
spell checker by unchecking the "Check your spelling as you type" checkbox. 

## Supported Languages

- German (de_DE)
- American English (en_US)
- Australian English (en_AU)
- British English (en_GB)
- French (fr_FR)
- Italian (it_IT)
- Polish (pl_PL)
- Romanian (ro_RO)
- Russian (ru_RU)
- Spanish (es_ES)
